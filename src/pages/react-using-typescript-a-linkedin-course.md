This was a very small course (52 mins) by Emmanuel Henri [React: Using TypeScript](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-using-typescript/create-web-apps-using-the-react-component-approach-with-typescript). If you have good experience of React and javascript, then this is the best course to learn typescript and add typescript to your react project.

## Some learning from the course are :-

1. You can easily convert your create-react-app code to typescript without ejecting. If your react-scripts >= 2.1.1, then just  install typescript into the project using yarn or npm, and run yarn start and react-scripts will automatically add typescript support into the project and create the tsconfig.files.
2. You can add typescript one file at a time. Just convert your js/jsx files to ts/tsx and keep adding the typescript types.
3. In typescript you can provide types for the variables your creating (string|array|number etc).
4. You can assign a return type for your functions.

## Why typescript ?

You spend some time initially to setup and learn typescript. But on the long run you end up saving a lot of time, because errors due to type mismatch will be caught in the development phase itself. Hence you save all that debugging/bug fixing time. And most of the productions issues are around types.

There are many other points too, which are discussed in numerous blogs, So no point repeating them.

That was a good hour spent. Will try to learn and share more such experiences.
