title: My new Journey with Algorithms and data structures
description: My new attempt at learning algorithms and data structures
---
*I am a javascript developer for the last 7 years, and have been majorly working in the frontend domain using react/react native.*

I﻿ passed out of college studying computer science in 2015. Since then I have worked in 4 companies. And my usual reason leave to my company, would be that it was closing due to funding issue.

A﻿nd everytime I am on the job market, I was scared as hell, because I have to answer Data structure and algorithm questions in the interviews.

I﻿ am usually confident with my frontend stuff, but data structure and algorithms used to be scary as hell for me. I hardly use them in my day to day life as a javascript developer and ***I always used to crib, why on earth are you asking such tough DSA questions.***

I﻿ have been asked the infamous rain trapping question, some weird tree question and random dsa questions where I had no idea, how to solve them.

W﻿hen I lost my job during covid, I was so confident, that I will get a job very easily anywhere because of my frontend skills. But boy, I was so wrong, 1-2 months of interviewing in major companies and getting rejected because of the DSA questions.
